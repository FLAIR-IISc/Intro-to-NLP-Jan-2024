## DS207: Introduction to Natural Language Processing

**Instructor**: [Danish Pruthi](https://danishpruthi.com/)

**Term**: January 2024 – May 2024

**Time**: Tuesdays & Thursdays (11-1:30)

**Venue**: CDS 102

**Credits**: 3:1

**Outline**: This course is a graduate-level introduction to the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), which involves building computational systems to handle human languages. We interact with NLP systems on a daily basis—such systems answer the questions we ask (using Google, or other search engines), curate the content we read, autocomplete words we are likely to type, translate text from languages we don’t know, flag content on social media that we might find harmful, etc. Such systems are prominently used in industry as well as academia, especially for analyzing textual data. 

**Expected Outcomes**: The course aspires to equip students with the key ideas to confidently tackle NLP problems. The assignments in the course would enable students to develop, debug and evaluate NLP systems in practice.

**Prerequisites**: The class is intended for graduate students and senior undergraduates. We do not plan to impose any strict requisites on IISc courses that one should have completed to register for this course. However, students are expected to know the basics of linear algebra, probability, calculus, and neural networks. Programming assignments would require proficiency in Python.  



### Course Content

The detailed schedule would be available shortly, 
 tentatively, we plan to cover
text classification & representation learning (Week 1-2),
(large & not-so-large) language models (Week 3-6),
conditioned generation, including machine translation, summarization (Week 7-8),
multilinguality (Week 9),
structured prediction and decoding techniques (Week 10-11),
information extraction (Week 12), and broader societal and ethical implications 
of language technologies (Week 13-14).


### Course Evaluation

The evaluation comprises 3 programming assignments (3 x 15% = 45% of the overall score), 2 exams (2 x 10% of the overall grade), and final group course project (which is worth 35% of the overall grade).  

The three programming assignments will involve building systems for (1) text classification and learning word representations; (2) language modeling; (3) TBD (possibly machine translation and/or named entity recognition). The assignments will be implemented using interactive Python notebooks intended to run on Google’s Colab infrastructure. This allows students to use GPUs for free and with minimal setup. The notebooks will contain instructions interleaved with code blocks for students to fill in.

The two exams aim to evaluate the student’s learning acquired through lectures and assignments. One of these two exams would be administered towards the middle of the semester and the second one towards the end. Each exam is worth 10% of the grade. 

The final project constitutes 35% of the overall score, where students—in groups of three—get a chance to apply the acquired knowledge for an application of their choice. Projects would typically involve human languages and deep learning. The project includes three milestones: (1) initial proposal (which will require a rough action plan and associated timelines); (2) a mid-term report and (3) a final report.
