## DS207: Introduction to Natural Language Processing

**Instructor**: [Danish Pruthi](https://danishpruthi.com/)

**Term**: January 2024 – May 2024

**Credits**: 3:1

**Outline**: This course is a graduate-level introduction to the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), which involves building computational systems to handle human languages. We interact with NLP systems on a daily basis—such systems answer the questions we ask (using Google, or other search engines), curate the content we read, autocomplete words we are likely to type, translate text from languages we don’t know, flag content on social media that we might find harmful, etc. Such systems are prominently used in industry as well as academia, especially for analyzing textual data. 

**Expected Outcomes**: The course aspires to equip students with the key ideas to confidently tackle NLP problems. The assignments in the course would enable students to develop, debug and evaluate NLP systems in practice.
